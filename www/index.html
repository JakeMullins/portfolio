    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Jake Mullins, and I am studying Computer Science at BYU.</p>

    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Exoplanet Counter using Node.js and MongoDB</li>
        <li>Seinfeld Script Webscraper using BeautifulSoup4</li>
        <li>Arduino Greenhouse Control</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Work Experience</h1>
    <p>Absolutely nothing technology related</p>
    <p>Which is probably a good thing, since I'm only 18. I don't want to be the spoiled kid who was able to score an internship at his dad's tech company.</p>
